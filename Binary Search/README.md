# Binary Search 🔍

## Problem Statement

Write a function that takes in a **sorted array** of integers as well as a **target integer**. The function should use the **Binary Search** algorithm to determine if the target integer is contained in the array and should return its index if it is, otherwise return `-1`.

> If you're unfamiliar with Binary Search, review the conceptual overview before writing code.
