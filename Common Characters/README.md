# Common Characters 🟢⭐

Write a function that takes in a non-empty list of non-empty strings and returns a list of characters that are common to all strings in the list, **ignoring multiplicity**.

> Note that the strings are not guaranteed to only contain alphanumeric characters.  
> The list you return can be in **any order**.

## 🧪 Sample Input

```python
strings = ["abc", "bcd", "cbaccd"]
```

## ✅ Sample Output

```
["b", "c"]  # The characters could be ordered differently.
```
