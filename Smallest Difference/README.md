# Smallest Difference

This repository contains a Python solution to find the pair of numbers (one from each of two non-empty arrays of integers) whose absolute difference is closest to zero. The function returns an array containing these two numbers, with the number from the first array in the first position.

## ðŸ§© Problem Description

The **absolute difference** of two numbers is the distance between them on the real number line.  
For example:
- The absolute difference of -5 and 5 is 10.
- The absolute difference of 2 and -4 is 6.

You can assume that:
- Each array is non-empty.
- There will only be **one unique pair** of numbers with the smallest difference.

## âœ… Sample Input

```python
arrayOne = [-1, 5, 10, 20, 28, 3]
arrayTwo = [26, 134, 135, 15, 17]
```
## ðŸŽ¯ Sample Output

```
[28, 26]
