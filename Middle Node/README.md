# ðŸ§© Middle Node - Linked List Problem

You're given a **Linked List** with at least one node. Write a function that returns the **middle node** of the Linked List. 

If the list has an **even number of nodes**, return the **second** of the two middle nodes.

Each `LinkedList` node has:
- an integer `value`
- a `next` pointer to the next node in the list or `None` / `null` if it's the tail

---

## ðŸ§ª Sample Input

```
linkedList = 2 -> 7 -> 7 -> 3 -> 5
```
## âœ… Sample Output

```
3 -> 5
 or // The middle could be 7 or 3, we return the second middle node
```
