# Move Element to End

## Problem Description

You're given an array of integers and an integer value. Write a function that moves **all instances** of that integer to the **end of the array** in place and returns the modified array.

- The operation must be done **in place** (i.e., mutate the input array).
- The order of the other elements **does not need to be preserved**.
