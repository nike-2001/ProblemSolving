âœ… Validate Subsequence
This is a Python function that checks whether one list is a subsequence of another.

ðŸš€ Problem Statement
Given two non-empty arrays of integers, write a function that determines whether the second array is a subsequence of the first one.

A subsequence of an array is a set of elements that appear in the same order as they do in the array, but not necessarily adjacent to each other.

ðŸ§  Example
array = [5, 1, 22, 25, 6, -1, 8, 10]
sequence = [1, 6, -1, 10]

âœ… Output:
True
