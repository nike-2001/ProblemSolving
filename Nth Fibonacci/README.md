# 🟢 Nth Fibonacci

The Fibonacci sequence is defined as follows: the first number of the sequence is `0`, the second number is `1`, and the nth number is the sum of the (n - 1)th and (n - 2)th numbers.

Write a function that takes in an integer `n` and returns the nth Fibonacci number.

## 📌 Important Note:

The Fibonacci sequence is often defined with its first two numbers as:

- F₀ = 0  
- F₁ = 1

For the purpose of this question, the first Fibonacci number is **F₀**; therefore:

- `getNthFib(1)` → F₀  
- `getNthFib(2)` → F₁  
- `getNthFib(3)` → F₂, and so on.

## ✅ Sample Input #1
```
n = 2
```
## ✅ Sample Output #1
```
1  // 0, 1
```

## ✅ Sample Input #2
```
n = 6
```
## ✅ Sample Output #2
```
5  // 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5
```
