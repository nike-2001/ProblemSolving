# 🔠 First Non-Repeating Character

Write a function that takes in a string of lowercase English-alphabet letters and returns the index of the string's **first non-repeating character**.

The first non-repeating character is the first character in a string that occurs only once.

If the input string doesn’t have any non-repeating characters, your function should return `-1`.
