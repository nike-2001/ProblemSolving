# Find Closest Value in BST âœ…ðŸŒ²

## ðŸ§  Problem Statement

Write a function that takes in a **Binary Search Tree (BST)** and a **target integer value**, and returns the closest value to that target value contained in the BST.

You can assume that there will only be **one closest value**.

Each `BST` node has:
- an integer `value`
- a `left` child node
- a `right` child node

A node is said to be a valid BST node **if and only if** it satisfies the **BST property**:
- Its `value` is strictly greater than the values of every node to its left.
- Its `value` is less than or equal to the values of every node to its right.
- Its children are either valid `BST` nodes themselves or `None` / `null`.
